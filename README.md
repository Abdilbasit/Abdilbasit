### 📂 **Projects**
- **Robo-Uber AI – AI-Powered Taxi Dispatch System**
  - Robo-Uber AI is a simulation-based taxi dispatch system that optimizes ride allocation using AI and agent-based modeling. It simulates autonomous taxis navigating a virtual city, responding to ride requests, and competing for fares through a dynamic bidding system. The system incorporates real-time dispatching, path optimization, and a competitive fare bidding mechanism, making it an efficient and scalable solution for ride-hailing simulations. This project highlights my expertise in Python, AI-driven decision-making, and simulation modeling. 🚖💡
