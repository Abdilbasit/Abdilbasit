### 🔨 **Currently Working On**
- **🖐 Hand Gesture Recognition**
   - The focus of this project is the creation of an advanced hand gesture recognition system, with a webcam feed being used to control computer mouse and keyboard functions. With the powerful hand-tracking model by Media Pipe integrated with a machine learning-based gesture classification algorithm, the system will enable users to create various actions like clicking, dragging, and typing simply by moving their hands. The goal is to improve user experience and efficiency through natural gesture-based controls.

### 📂 **Projects**
- **Robo-Uber AI – AI-Powered Taxi Dispatch System**
  - Robo-Uber AI is a simulation-based taxi dispatch system that optimizes ride allocation using AI and agent-based modeling. It simulates autonomous taxis navigating a virtual city, responding to ride requests, and competing for fares through a dynamic bidding system. The system incorporates real-time dispatching, path optimization, and a competitive fare bidding mechanism, making it an efficient and scalable solution for ride-hailing simulations. This project highlights my expertise in Python, AI-driven decision-making, and simulation modeling. 🚖💡

-  **Neural-Networks Multilayer-perceptron vs Multi Cover Persistence**
   - This project explores the performance and effectiveness of Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP) compared to Multi-Cover Persistence in machine learning tasks. The MLP, a deep learning architecture, is trained using backpropagation and gradient descent to optimize classification accuracy, while Multi-Cover Persistence, a topological data analysis method, provides insights into data structure and feature significance. The comparison highlights how neural networks excel in predictive modeling, whereas persistence-based methods offer robustness in capturing complex topological features. This project demonstrates the strengths and trade-offs of both approaches, making it a valuable study in AI-driven pattern recognition and classification.

-  **Employee Management REST API**
   -  A robust RESTful API built with Spring Boot that demonstrates full-stack Java development. This project allows users to perform CRUD operations on employee records using Spring Data JPA with an H2 in-memory database. It showcases my ability to design and implement scalable, production-ready applications, complete with comprehensive exception handling and a clean, modular code structure.

-  **Personal Finance Tracker**
   -  A desktop application built with WPF and the MVVM pattern, allowing users to track incomes and expenses. This project leverages Entity Framework Core with an in-memory SQLite database to demonstrate local data persistence and clean, maintainable UI logic. It highlights my ability to develop rich, user-friendly applications using modern C# and design principles.
