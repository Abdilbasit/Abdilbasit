## 📂 Projects

### 🚖 **Robo-Uber AI – AI-Powered Taxi Dispatch System**
- **Overview:** A simulation-based taxi dispatch system that uses AI and agent-based modeling to optimize ride allocation. Autonomous taxis navigate a virtual city, respond to ride requests, and compete through dynamic fare bidding.  
- **Highlights:** Real-time dispatching, path optimization, and competitive fare bidding showcase my expertise in Python, AI-driven decision-making, and simulation modeling.  
- **[View Project](https://github.com/Abdilbasit/Robo-Uber-AI)**

### 🤖 **Neural-Networks Multilayer-perceptron vs Multi Cover Persistence**
- **Overview:** A comparative study between Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP) and Multi-Cover Persistence in machine learning tasks.  
- **Highlights:**  
  - **MLP:** Trained using backpropagation and gradient descent for classification accuracy.  
  - **Multi-Cover Persistence:** Offers insights into data structure and feature significance via topological data analysis.  
- **Objective:** Demonstrates the strengths and trade-offs between neural networks and persistence-based methods in pattern recognition and classification.  
- **[View Project](https://github.com/Abdilbasit/Neural-Networks---Multilayer-perceptron-vs-Multi-Cover-Persistence)**

### 💼 **Employee Management REST API**
- **Overview:** A robust RESTful API built with Spring Boot that enables CRUD operations on employee records using Spring Data JPA and an H2 in-memory database.  
- **Highlights:** Emphasizes scalable, production-ready application design, comprehensive exception handling, and clean, modular code architecture.  
- **[View Project](https://github.com/Abdilbasit/Employee-Management-REST-API)**

### 💰 **Personal Finance Tracker**
- **Overview:** A desktop application built with WPF and the MVVM pattern to track incomes and expenses.  
- **Highlights:** Utilizes Entity Framework Core with an in-memory SQLite database to demonstrate local data persistence and maintainable UI logic.  
- **[View Project](https://github.com/Abdilbasit/PersonalFinanceTracker)**

### ☀️ **Weather Dashboard**
- **Overview:** A responsive web application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS that fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.  
- **Highlights:** Showcases asynchronous JavaScript (using the Fetch API), dynamic DOM manipulation, and modern web development practices.
